# FCLI Foundational Components CLI
- Helps spread the AwesomeSauce of the Foundational Components team a bit further.


## Getting Started
- We recommend using Python 3.

<code>
cd fcli<br/>  

python3.6 setup.py install<br/>
</code>

This will install the binary fcli in /usr/local/bin

you will need to create a ~/.fcli file with your credentials similar to the fcli.ini in the root of this repo.

## Usage

to add a task associated with a parent story-

```fcli task "Task title" "Task description" <parent story ID>```
